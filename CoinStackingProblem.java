/*
The task is to take in the radius of a coin, the thickness of a coin, and a target distance for how much the coin tower should lean over the edge of a tableâ€‹

You then output the minimum height of that tower of coins

This is known as the block stacking problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-stacking_problem)
